# RedditCloneAngular

This project implements my [reddit-clone-backend](https://github.com/markogresak/reddit-clone-backend) API (hosted at https://reddit-eu.herokuapp.com/).

This page is served at https://markogresak.github.io/reddit-clone-angular/.

The goal is to showcase how to build basic frontend app features in a given framework.

Other examples:

- [reddit-clone-react](https://github.com/markogresak/reddit-clone-react)
- [reddit-clone-elm](https://github.com/markogresak/reddit-clone-elm)

_Disclaimer: The linked projects are old and outdated. I would do a lot differently if I started the projects today._
